# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help developers create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and have become fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming.

## Why SOLID Matters

SOLID principles help us:

- Create code that's easier to maintain and extend
- Reduce technical debt
- Make testing simpler
- Build systems that can evolve with changing requirements
- Avoid code smells and anti-patterns

## The Five SOLID Principles

### 1. [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](single-responsibility.md)

> A class should have only one reason to change.

Each class should have only one job or responsibility. If a class handles multiple concerns, it becomes coupled to those concerns, making it harder to maintain.

### 2. [Open-Closed Principle (OCP)](open-closed.md)

> Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

You should be able to extend a class's behavior without modifying it. This is typically achieved through abstractions and polymorphism.

### 3. [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](liskov-substitution.md)

> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

### 4. [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](interface-segregation.md)

> Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

Instead of one large interface, many small, specific interfaces are preferred. This keeps systems decoupled and easier to refactor.

### 5. [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](dependency-inversion.md)

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
> Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

This reduces coupling between modules and makes testing easier through dependency injection and the use of interfaces.

## SOLID in Practice

SOLID principles work together to create systems that are:

- **Modular** - Components can be developed, tested, and maintained in isolation
- **Resilient to change** - Changes in one area don't cascade throughout the system
- **Testable** - Dependencies are explicit and can be mocked or stubbed
- **Reusable** - Components are focused and can be reused in different contexts

Throughout this guide, you'll see how these principles integrate with other architectural concepts like Domain-Driven Design and Microservices to create robust, maintainable systems.
