# Software Architecture Guide

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on software architecture. This resource is designed to help our team develop a shared understanding of architectural principles, patterns, and best practices.

## Purpose of This Guide

This guide serves as a learning resource to help engineers at all levels:

- Understand key architectural concepts
- Apply design patterns effectively
- Learn domain-driven design principles
- Master microservices architecture
- Implement SOLID principles
- Develop a common vocabulary for discussing architecture

## Focus Areas

Based on our team's needs, this guide particularly focuses on:

1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** - Designing software around the business domain
2. **Microservices Architecture** - Building distributed systems with independent services
3. **SOLID Principles** - Fundamental principles for creating maintainable software

## How to Use This Guide

This guide is structured to support both deep study and quick reference:

- Start with the core concepts in each section
- Explore practical examples that demonstrate principles in action
- Use the navigation to find specific topics of interest

Each section includes Python (and sometimes TypeScript) examples to illustrate concepts in a way that's relevant to our tech stack and daily work.

## Getting Started

For those new to software architecture, we recommend starting with:

1. [SOLID Principles Overview](solid/index.md) - Core principles of object-oriented design
2. [Domain-Driven Design Overview](ddd/index.md) - Understanding DDD fundamentals
3. [Microservices Overview](architecture/microservices/index.md) - Introduction to microservices

For those looking to apply these concepts immediately in our codebase, check out:
- [Python Backend Examples](examples/python-backend.md)
- [TypeScript Backend Examples](examples/typescript-backend.md)

## Contributing to This Guide

This is a living document. As our team grows and evolves, so should this guide. We encourage contributions through pull requests to our documentation repository.

Let's build better software together through thoughtful architecture!
